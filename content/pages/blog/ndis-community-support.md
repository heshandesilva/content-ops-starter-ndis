### How to Access NDIS Community Support

Accessing [NDIS community support](https://inclusion.ymca.org.au/services/11-community-support/) begins with understanding eligibility. Participants must be under 65 and meet certain disability criteria.

Once eligibility is confirmed, the planning process follows. Here, participants work with planners to develop personalized plans.
